## Task: Build your own conversational Search Engine

This task is very much about creativity. Do you have an innovative idea for a new, exciting search application? The [OpenWebSearch.eu](https://openwebsearch.eu/) initiative encourages all teams to make their ideas come true and work on interesting new concepts around Web Search. The teams will not need to start from scratch, but they can build off of an existing [Prototype Search Application](https://opencode.it4i.eu/openwebsearcheu-public/prototype-search-application). This prototype relies on data provided by the Open Web Index, which makes the Search Application independent from proprietary Web Indices. It is up to your choice whether you want to focus on the search backend, which is implemented in Java, the web frontend or concentrate on the conceptual elaboration. In order open more opportunities for the participants, we additionally provide an API endpoint for a LLaMA 2 model.
